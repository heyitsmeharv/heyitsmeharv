## 🚀 About Me

My name is Adam, but you can call me Harv.

I'm from Oxford, England 🇬🇧 and I'm currently working at [**Davies-Group**](https://technology.davies-group.com/technology/) 💼

I started my professional career as a front-end developer since graduating with a degree in software for games 🕹️👾🎮. 
I have since branched out into many different roles, taking on both problem solving, client facing and leadership roles. I would 
describe myself as being a fun, friendly, enthusiastic problem solver with an inquisitive mindset.

In my spare time you can catch me:
- 📝 Blogging [**here**](https://www.heyitsmeharv.com/blog).
- ♟️ Hanging my Queen in Chess
- 🇪🇸  Aprendiendo Castiano

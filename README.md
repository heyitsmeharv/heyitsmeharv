## 🚀 About Me

My name is Adam, but you can call me Harv.

I'm from Oxford, England 🇬🇧 and currently I'm working at [**Davies-Group**](https://technology.davies-group.com/technology/) 💼

I started my professional career as a mere front-end developer since graduating with a degree in software for games 🕹️👾🎮. 
I have since branched out into many different roles. I guess you can say that I've got an inquisitive mindset and an enthusiasm for knowing how things work.

In my spare time you can catch me
- 🇪🇸 Duolingo
- ♟️ Chess
- 📝 Writing about technologies which you can find [**here**](https://www.heyitsmeharv.com/blog).
